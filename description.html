					<h1>Element Database and Analytical system</h1><br>
					<h2>Detailed description</h2>
					<p>Access to affordable, healthy, and nutritious food is among the key determinants of health. Chemical elements are important for nutrition and health. Elements can be essential or beneficial for health because they are the components of major structural components in the body (Ca, P, S), they help maintenance of electrochemical equilibria, activation, or signaling (Ca, K, Mg, Na), or they are  components of enzymes or hormones (Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, I, Mn, Mo, Ni, Se, Sn, V, Zn) . More than 20 elements are considered as toxic risk (Ag, As, Au, Be, Bi, Cd, Ce, Ch, Co, Cu, Fe, Ga, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Pt, Sb, Sn, Te, Th, U, V, and Zn) and seven of them are considered as high-risk (As, Al, Cd, Cr, Fe, Hg, and Pb). The improvements in instrumentation, such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and advanced computational algorithms enabled accurate and affordable measurement of more than 70 elements at reasonable cost even in tiny concentrations (as low as one part in 10ยนโต). Elemental profiles in various foods enable the assessment of safety, security, and quality of food as well as prevention of food crime. Data representing elemental composition in various foods data are accumulating at an accelerating speed, but these data are scattered across literature and various web sites and are not available in a unified information system. Professor Brusic and colleagues have proposed such a database and analysis systems whereby complex food data (field measurements, geographic location, weather data, pollution, etc.) are combined with elemental profile measurements and stored in a database and analyzed to trace the origin and assess the quality and safety of foods. This project will focus on the design and implement the database and analysis system of elemental profiles in foods. This product will use software engineering process, to deliver the proposed software product as a functional prototype. The team will analyze user requirements for the prototype and develop a complete set of SE project requirements, design the system, and implement a database and analytical tools (including functionalities for search, visualization, basic statistical analysis, and classification tasks). The analysis will include feature selection for classification using Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines.</p>
